# BATSON

Batson is a multiplatform application (iOS and Android support) to perform movies and actors recognition. You could use a short video stored in your device or capture a new short video with the device camera. Once the video is sent to the backend server, the video will be subdivided into two parts (Audio and Video). After that, using IA trained models, Batson will obtain the actors and the related movie.
